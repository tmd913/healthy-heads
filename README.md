# Healthy Heads
By Tom Dennis (project lead), Irene Rojas, Morgan Bradley, and Rohit Maharjan.

Healthy Heads is a resource for finding dedicated mental health professionals. 

The project incorporates a login feature, and the ability to sign up. Once inside, a user can search for professionals by city, state, specialty, insurance, language, gender, and years in practice. Even before searching, a user can see all the professionals. Profiles include a photo (from randomuser.me), address, and the aforementioned search parameters.

We used Sequelize, Handlebars, Passport.js, mySQL, Materialize, and CSS to create and style the pages. The basis for the logo came from: https://image.freepik.com/free-icon/brain-inside-human-head_318-46850.jpg.
