# Healthy Heads
By Tom Dennis (project lead), Irene Rojas, Morgan Bradley, and Rohit Maharjan.

Healthy Heads is a resource for finding dedicated mental health professionals. 

The project incorporates a login feature, and the ability to sign up. Once inside, a user can search for professionals by city, state, specialty, insurance, language, gender, and years in practice. Even before searching, a user can see all the professionals. Profiles include a photo (from randomuser.me), address, and the aforementioned search parameters.

We used Node, Express, mySQL, Sequelize, Handlebars, Passport.js, and Materialize on this project.
